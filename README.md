# Quantum_LDPC_Codes
Collection of quantum LDPC codes

Hyperbolic Codes Planar: a collection of planar hyperbolic codes ordered by Schl√§fli symbol {f,d} of the corresponding infinite graph.  These are CSS codes whose Z and X generators are edge-site incidence matrices of a pair of mutually dual locally planar vertex transitive graphs, finite quotients of the regular hyperbolic tiling.
